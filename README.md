**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

1.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

   The term software engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the 
   software crisis—a period when software projects frequently failed due to increasing complexity, cost overruns, and 
   missed deadlines.
   
This milestone emphasized the need for structured methodologies, disciplined programming practices, and systematic software development approaches.
2.The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s - 1980s)

Introduced by Edsger Dijkstra, structured programming promoted writing clean, modular, and readable code to reduce software complexity.
Techniques such as top-down design, flowcharts, and subroutines improved software maintainability and debugging.
The Waterfall Model (proposed by Winston Royce in 1970) became the first widely accepted software development lifecycle (SDLC) approach.
3.The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001 - Present)

The Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development over rigid processes.
Agile replaced traditional Waterfall methods in many industries, leading to the rise of Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps.
This milestone significantly improved software delivery speed, customer satisfaction, and adaptability to change.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

1.Requirement Analysis
  Involves gathering and defining the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.
  Stakeholders, including clients and developers, collaborate to ensure all needs are documented.
  
2.Planning
  A feasibility study is conducted to assess technical, financial, and resource requirements.
  A project roadmap is created, defining timelines, budget, and risk management strategies.
3.Design

Software architecture, system models, and data structures are planned.
UI/UX design and database structures are also considered in this phase.
4.Implementation (Coding)

Developers write the actual source code based on the design specifications.
Programming best practices, version control, and documentation are followed.
5.Testing

The software is tested for bugs, security issues, and performance flaws.
Methods like unit testing, integration testing, and system testing are applied.
6.Deployment

The software is released for use, either as a pilot launch or full-scale deployment.
Continuous monitoring is done to ensure smooth operation.
7.Maintenance & Support

Bug fixes, updates, and enhancements are made based on user feedback.
Ensures long-term software stability and performance improvements.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

Waterfall follows a sequential, phase-based approach where each stage (e.g., requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next while  Agile, is iterative and incremental, delivering working software in smaller cycles called sprints.

Waterfall is rigid—once a phase is completed, making changes is difficult and costly while Agile is highly flexible, allowing teams to adapt to changes even in later stages of development.

In Waterfall, customer involvement is minimal after the initial requirements phase, as the focus is on following the predefined plan while Agile requires continuous collaboration with customers, with frequent feedback shaping the evolving product.

Waterfall delivers the software only after all phases are completed, which may take months or years while Agile provides working software at the end of each iteration (usually every 2-4 weeks), ensuring faster delivery and early value realization.

In Waterfall, testing happens after development is completed, which may lead to late discovery of issues while Agile incorporates continuous testing throughout the development process, allowing early bug detection and fixes.
Example Scenarios:

Large-scale government projects with strict regulations (e.g., military or space programs).
Banking systems where compliance and security are paramount.
Infrastructure software, such as embedded systems in medical devices.
Agile – Best for Dynamic & Fast-Paced Projects
Example Scenarios:

Mobile app development where features evolve based on user feedback.
E-commerce platforms that need frequent updates (e.g., Amazon, Shopify).
Startups and software products requiring continuous iteration and innovation.
